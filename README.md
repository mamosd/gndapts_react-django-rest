## Development process

1. Everytime you work on a new feature, create a branch for it. 

    ```
    git pull origin master
    git checkout -b <feature_name>
    ```

2. Any code you add or change should go only on that new branch. Once you're done making changes, commit and push:

    ```
    git commit -m "<insert msg here>"
    git push origin <branch name>
    ```
    
3. Go to github and submit a pull request. Please fill out details about what you changed and how you made your changes. I will look it over and approve.
